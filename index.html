  <h2>A Little Bit About Me...</h2><br>
  <p>I was born and raised in the Houston area. Attended college at the University
    of Houston from 2008-2013. My degree is technically in Hotel and Resturant Management, 
    with a focus in event planning. I planned events for about two years before I realized that 
    I would much rather be in the education field. That led me to becoming a fron desk admin at 
    a local private high school. <br><br>
    I've traveled pretty regularly growing up, my dad worked for United and encouraged us to use his 
    benefits any chance we could. My house is always on the 
    verge of chaos with four dogs and two cats. I've been a runner on and off since my early 20s. I 
    decided to sign up for my first half marathon after returning from a big hiking trip. I ran the Aramco 
    half marathon in January 2020. Then the world shut down and running became more of a mental health check 
    in for me than anything else. <br><br>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
  <p>I've always been interested in the behind the scenes aspect of the internet and how websites work. I think 
    every millennial got a taste of it during the peak of myspace pages. Decided to finally take the leap after a 
    few (failed) months of self learning. Looking forward to learning as much as possible and building a rewarding career.

  <h3>Fun Facts:</h3><p>

    <li>I was set to celebrate my 30th on a Caribbean cruise, March 15, 2020. <p><strong>We all know how that went.</strong> ü•¥</p></li>
    <li>I'm a total Marvel junkie, but my true guilty pleasure is the Fast and the Furious saga. (I know nothing about cars.)</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h3>Animals that run my house, and own my heart:</h3><p>
